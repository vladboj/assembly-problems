# x86 AT&T Assembly Assignments

**This repository contains solutions to two university assignments implemented in x86 AT&T assembly language:**

## Instruction Interpreter

- Displaying Assembly Instructions: Given an input hexadecimal string, the program displays the corresponding assembly instruction to be executed on the standard output.
- Evaluating Arithmetic Instructions: The program evaluates arithmetic instructions in the assembly language of the considered arithmetic processor. These instructions consist only of integers and arithmetic operations. The program performs the operations according to the given instructions and prints the result to the standard output.
- Evaluating Instructions with Variables: This task involves evaluating instructions with variables introduced by "let". The program interprets these instructions, applies the defined variables, and evaluates the arithmetic expressions accordingly. It prints the final result to the standard output.

## Recursive Backtracking

The Recursive Backtracking program generates the smallest lexicographically ordered permutation of a set of elements where each element appears exactly three times. The permutation satisfies the condition of having a minimum distance of 'm' elements between any two equal elements. The program reads input values for 'n', 'm', and '3 * n', then generates the permutation and outputs it to the standard output. If no valid permutation exists, it outputs -1.

## Usage
To use the solutions provided in this repository:

- Ensure you have an x86 architecture environment set up.
- Compile the assembly code using an appropriate assembler.
- Execute the compiled binaries, providing necessary inputs as required by the respective problems.
